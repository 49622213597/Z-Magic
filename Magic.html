<h1>3 of a Kind:</h1>
<p>A shuffled deck of cards may be used. Make sure there are exactly 52 cards, and no jokers. Have the spectator pick out a 3 of a kind without showing you. Emphasize the fact that they must remember the exact cards and their suit of the cards that they picked, because a 4th card of the same value is somwhere in the deck, but the suit is different. Then, lay out four piles:
Pile 1: 10 cards
Pile 2: 15 cards
Pile 3: 15 cards
Pile 4: 9 cards
Have the spectator put on of their cards on each of the three first piles, and then pick up all the cards, pile by pile, from right to left. Then, tell the spectator that you will show them half the deck, and if they see one of their cards (only any of the three that they picked), then say stop. Now, alternate between the cards; place one card pace up on a pile, and the next card face down. After you are finished, the spectator should not have seen their card yet. Repeat this process with the remaining face up cards. The spectator should still not have seen their card. Repeat this process once more, but this time, start by placing a card face down, and then face up. After you are finished, the spectator should still not have seen their card. Now alternate for the last time, starting with turning a card face up and then face down. The spectator should still not have seen their card. You will have 3 cards remaining, and they should be the three that the spectator picked.

<h1> Read 5 Minds at Once:</h1>
<p> You will need 5 spectators for this trick. Explain to them that you will need 5 piles of cards, with 5 cards in each pile. Before you start the trick, have this set up:
1st card: 2 of Hearts
2nd Card: 4 of Hearts
3rd Card: 6 of Hearts
4th Card: 8 of Hearts
5th Card: 10 of Hearts
The rest of the deck may be mixed up and in any order. You can even perform shuffels and false shuffels, as long as the first 5 cards stay in their positions. Lay out the first 5 cards in 5 piles, saying that this is how the spectators must lay out the cards. Have them lay out any cards they want in any pile, as long as there are 5 cards per pile in the end (this includes the cards that you put down). Then, show spectator 1 pile 1, and have them remember any card they want. You can even shuffel the pile if you would like. Do the same with the other piles with the other spectators. Once all spectators have remembered a card, combine the piles into one big pile, stacking them up in any order you would like. Explain to the soectators that they got to choose which cards went in each pile from a shuffled deck of cards, and they remembered a card from one of the piles. Their thought of card is nowhere except their head, which makes the trick very fair. Now, lay out the cards one at a time in 5 piles horizontally. Then, make another horizontal pile of 5 cards below the first one. Continue until all the cards have been laid out. Now, ask the spectator which column their card is in. Spectator one looked at pile one, so the set-up card in that pile was the two of hearts. Find which row the 2 of hearts is in. Use coordinates; whichever card the spectator's column and the two of hearts meets at is the thought of card. Continue this with the other spectators, knowing which set-up card belongs to which spectator. Whenever you figure out their thought-of card, only point to it in a dramatic way, because all cards have to remain the way they are to make the trick work the whole entire way.
